# Gaming

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## White Hat Gaming challenge

The design that was supposed to be implemented is here 

![design](/src/assets/design.png)

I decided not to use any library so the project would be more lightweight.
The space probably is not exactly the same as it is in the design but it also shouldn't be much different and it is mobile friendly.
The top bar when in mobile shows ellipsis because I found it to be the easiest way without using media queries to make it look good. 

You can see examples of the application below
